User Story
How Many time we lose our objects? How many time we want to prove the ownership if people find out ? For Example...  bags lost in travel ,
mobilephones, kyes, or Laptops with serial code. With this simple project, people can register hownership of objects by contract. An user can register name, email, phone number, and serial number. Now he can stamp a label with address of ethereum contract. So user can prove the ownership. If a person find out your lost object, he can use the address of contract to find a owner's personal details to contact him.
